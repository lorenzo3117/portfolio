                    <h4>Flemish government: Verkeersmodellen</h4>
                    <p>
                        Traffic models are a tool used to study the effects of infrastructural, spatial, or policy measures on traffic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Traffic Models team at the Department of Mobility and Public Works uses different types of models, mainly strategic models for areas where traffic demand is still unknown, and dynamic models for more detailed analysis of traffic flow, congestion, and safety. These models support Flemish policy by enabling studies and scenario analyses, especially in collaboration with government entities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The web application is built with Java (Spring Boot), Angular and PostgreSQL. AWS is used for hosting the application.

                    <h4>Flemish government: DCBaaS</h4>
                    <p>
                        DCBaaS is a platform that allows organizations to independently request and manage X.509 digital certificates for their applications or APIs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The platform supports full self-service, enabling authorized users to create, renew, revoke, and monitor certificates without centralized intervention. It integrates with the Flemish government's identity management system (IDM) to control user access rights and provides notifications about certificate expirations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The web application is built with Java (Spring Boot), React and PostgreSQL. AWS is used for hosting the application and Jenkins for CI/CD.

                    <p>
                        Chiron is the central ride database system for taxi service operators in Flanders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a taxi service owner, you are required to send information about your rides to Chiron, which acts as a central database for collecting and managing ride data.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Internship at MyGamePlan.ai</h4>
                    <p>
                        In March 2022, I did an internship at MyGamePlan.ai.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the web application built with React and TypeScript, football clubs can analyze and plan their matches. The players can use the mobile application, developed with React Native, to see their stats and improve themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this internship I learned advanced concept of React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React Native. Working in a team was also a new experience for me.
